About UploadToJive.exe
======================

This program allows you to upload many TXT and HTML files in one shot into Documents into a specific JIVE group in Jive Cloud.

Note that it does not upload the image files that could be referenced in the original .html files ;)

Using it
========
 
1) Download the application "UploadToJiveDocuments.exe"

Save it on your computer
There is no installation required. Anyone can use it.
 
2) Double click the app
 
3) fill in the dialog box

IMPORTANT: IF YOU ACCESS INTERNET THROUGH A PROXY THIS REQUIRES the following: 
fill in "More CURL parameters" with the following information:
-x http://myproxy.com:myproxyport --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k
 
Using <userID> and <password> tells the system to use the same userID and password
and the ones you provided above in the form.

Advanced features
=================
 
Using a config file
-------------------
 
To make things easier for your team, you can create a file named UploadToJiveDocuments.cfg,
which will provide pre populated fields in UploadToJive.exe form. Set the fields
you want with the values you want. The ones not used will be skipped.
 
List of available fields:
  jiveInstanceURL
  filePattern
  tags
  categories
  placeName
  updateExisting
  username
  password
  curlExtra
  debug (set to 1 for debug - will output server responses to "out.txt" file)
 
Format of UploadToJiveDocuments.cfg:
{ 
"jiveInstanceURL" : "https://mycompany.jiveon.com",
"curlExtra" : "-x http://myproxy.com:myproxyport --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k"
}
 
Drop it in the same folder as UploadToJiveDocuments.exe. When the user starts UploadToJiveDocuments.exe the fields will already have the values you defined.
 

Command Line
------------
 
Alternatively, you can upload without opening the dialog box, using a Command Line
 
If you do not understand what a "command line" is then use the other method ;-)

For command line usage, type the command
UploadToJiveDocuments.exe ?
and you will find how to use it. Here's an example
UploadToJiveDocuments.exe "https://mycompany.jiveon.com" "c:/temp/*.htm*" "test" "" "102020" 1 myuserid mYpAssWord "-x http://gateway.zscaler.net:9480 --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k"
