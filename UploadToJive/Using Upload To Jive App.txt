Advanced features
=================
 
Using a config file
-------------------
 
To make things easier for your team, you can create a file named UploadToJive.cfg,
which will provide pre populated fields in UploadToJive.exe form. Set the fields
you want with the values you want. The ones not used will be skipped.
 
List of available fields:
  jiveInstanceURL
  filePattern
  tags
  categories
  placeName
  updateExisting
  userID
  password
  curlExtra (extra CURL attributes for special cases (proxy, etc - see "More CURL parameters example above)
  debug (set debug to 1 to output Jive server response to the out.txt file)
  prompt (set prompt to "authenticate" to only prompt for username and password but no other field;set prompt to "none" for no prompt at all)
  list (read below, for multi file upload)
 
Example format of UploadToJive.cfg:
{ 
"jiveInstanceURL" : "https://mycompany.jiveon.com",
"curlExtra" : "-x http://myproxy.com:myproxyport --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k"
}
 
Drop it in the same folder as UploadToJive.exe. When the user starts UploadToJive.exe the fields will already have the values you defined.


Using a config file to upload many files with different attributes to different places
-------------------

To upload multiple files with different parameters, provide the attributes in a multi levels
level 0: list
level 1: placeName
level 1: list
level 2: fileName, tags, categories[, subject][, text]  
example: "list" : [{"placeName" : "Jive Anywhere test group","list" : [{"filePattern" : "c:/temp/s*.jpg","tags":["blue","green"]},{"filePattern" : "c:/temp/k*.png","tags":["purple","lemon"],"text":"<body><div class=\"jive-rendered-content\"><p>adding some description</p><p><strong>some bold text</strong></p><p style=\"min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\";\">and a cell in a table</td><td style=\";\">another celle</td></tr><tr><td style=\";\">and a 3 cell in a table</td><td style=\";\">another 4 cell</td></tr></tbody></table></div></body>"}]}]

 

Command Line
------------
 
You can upload using a Command Line and based on the UploadToJive.cfg file, user may or not be prompted for input.
 
If you do not understand what a "command line" is then use the other method (see "Using it" section above)
