Advanced features
=================
 
Using a config file
-------------------
 
To make things easier for your team, you can create a file named UploadToJive.cfg,
which will provide pre populated fields in UploadToJive.exe form. Set the fields
you want with the values you want. The ones not used will be skipped.
 
List of available fields:
  jiveInstanceURL
  filePattern
  tags
  categories
  placeName
  updateExisting
  username
  password
  curlExtra
  debug
 
Format of UploadToJive.cfg:
{ 
"jiveInstanceURL" : "https://mycompany.jiveon.com",
"curlExtra" : "-x http://myproxy.com:myproxyport --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k"
}
 
Drop it in the same folder as UploadToJive.exe. When the user starts UploadToJive.exe the fields will already have the values you defined..
 

Command Line
------------
 
Alternatively, you can upload without opening the dialog box, using a Command Line
 
If you do not understand what a "command line" is then use the other method ;-)

For command line usage, type the command
UploadToJive.exe ?
and you will find how to use it. Here's an example
UploadToJive.exe "https://mycompany.jiveon.com" "c:/temp/w*.png" "test" "" "102020" 1 myuserid mYpAssWord "-x http://gateway.zscaler.net:9480 --proxy-user <userID>:<password> -k"
